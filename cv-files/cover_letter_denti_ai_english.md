My experience fully aligns with the technical requirements of the position. I have over 6 years of experience working with React and ES6, including creating mobile applications and web interfaces. I have extensive experience designing and developing RESTful APIs and GraphQL services, deep understanding of CSS, DOM manipulation, and excellent skills with Chrome Developer Tools for debugging and optimization.

I particularly want to highlight my experience with AI technologies. At Aithor, I developed systems using OpenAI API and Qdrant vector databases for semantic search and natural language processing, which directly relates to the technologies used at Denti.AI.

My experience working in cross-functional teams includes collaboration with designers, product managers, and other developers in an Agile environment. At Alfa-Bank, I worked as Lead Frontend Developer, where I participated in creating user stories and project roadmaps. At Infobip, I developed a GraphQL platform with Apollo Federation, demonstrating the ability to work with complex distributed systems. Currently, I work as Tech Lead at VallettaSoftware, coordinating cross-functional teams.

My English level allows me to communicate effectively in an international team. My experience mentoring developers and participating in hiring demonstrates my communication skills and ability to work in teams.

Throughout my career, I have demonstrated autonomy, initiative, and the ability to meet deadlines. I make technical decisions independently, proactively propose process improvements, and actively participate in code reviews to improve development quality.

I am attracted to the opportunity to work for a company that uses cutting-edge AI technologies to solve real medical problems, has a strong team with expertise in machine learning and computer science, and aims for global impact in the dental industry.

I am ready to apply my experience to create innovative solutions that will help dentists worldwide provide better patient care. I would be happy to discuss how my skills and experience can contribute to Denti.AI's success.
